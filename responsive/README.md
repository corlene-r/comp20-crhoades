# lab5-test
#
# This lab took me a really, really long time – not because I didn't understand the context, but because the syntax of stuff took a really long time to get right. Honestly, I didn't find the provided resources to be super helpful (especially the one on responsive design), but this website https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/css-tutorial/css-sprites.php was super helpful. Especially the interactive code
#
# I used piazza but also talked to a friend named Darren who took this class last semester
#
# Honestly, I thought this was less straightforward than the previous lab and this probably took me 3-4 hrs,  (much longer than expected)
#
# I think I got it all right, though.
