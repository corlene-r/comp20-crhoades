# WORK IMPLEMENTED: I'm pretty sure I've implemented everything. I tried to make the timing fairly accurate, though it's not 100% perfect (as in everything roughly fits pretty well) but I'm happy with it (I'm not going more accurate than 0.5 seconds, really)
# 
# WORKED WITH: No one! This lab I figured out all on my own looking at class resources :)
# 
# HOURS SPENT: I dunno probably 1 hr about??? It didn't take too long
