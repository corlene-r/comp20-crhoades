# WORKING PARTS: 
	- I think it all works! I think the issue 4 I did was actually really fun so I'm particularly proud of that
# COLLABORATION: 
	- Some sites and what I used them for:
		- This was helpful for fiddling with urls using NoSQL injection: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/
		- I referenced this page a lot for character codes: https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref
		- This page for button help: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_buttons.asp
		- And of course piazza and other class resources
# TIME: 
	- Probably about 3 hours in total. I spent a lot of time trying to mess with memory because I thought it would be fun!
