# WORKING PARTS: So I think I implemented it all correctly if the capital "USER: [username]" is allowed. If not, sorry, I can change it ( ´＿｀) <- sad me

# COLLABORATION: I looked at reference stuff (like provided examples on github) but otherwise I was a lone wolf
#
# This was short like 30 mins, maybe 45 mins at max
