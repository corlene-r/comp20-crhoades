# ------PART I--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# WORKING PARTS: 
	- I think it all works so that makes me a happy girl
# COLLABORATION: 
	-I did ask a few questions on piazza (and used the API you provided for this lab) but didn't talk to anyone else about it (other that showing my un-web-programming-experienced friend the cool thingy I did)
# TIME: 
	- Probably about 1.5 hours in total
# ------PART II------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
#
# WORKING PARTS: 
	- It all works! The polyline and vehicle distance is found, and I even added the pop-up
# TIME: 
	- Probably like 3 hours I think. Working on it has been awkwardly on/off so I don't have a really good estimate
# COLLABORATION: 
	- None with other humans, but I did use a few websites, credited below:
    	- For help with Polyline: https://www.sitepoint.com/create-a-polyline-using-the-geolocation-and-the-google-maps-api/ 
    	- More polyline stuff: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/polyline-simple
    	- Course's Piazza (It was helpful - since I'm a bit late to the party, everyone asked all the questions I needed to ask!)
    	- Also, used google's maps API and reference for it (duh)
# ------PART III------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# WORKING PARTS:
	- I only did the basic implementation for this lab, but it all works (life's just been weird and crazy lately). Server side stuff is in node-js-getting-started, on my (corlene-r's) github
# TIME:
	- Probably 2 hours total. I spent a lotta time confused about servers
# COLLABORATION: 
	- Comp 20 examples were great; otherwise, not much talked about
# NOTE: 
	- Maybe I'll come back later to implement more but I've really been trying to take schoolwork slow these last few days. I just moved friday and have been in a car going cross country, so I'll be in Chicago for my grandma's memorial service, so it's been hectic basically. I just wanted to say that I've really appreciated the people around me – family, friends, teachers, boyfriend, classmates, etc - who have been super nice and understanding (even though they proooobably won't read the notes on my comp project).
