# WORKING PARTS: I think it all works so that makes me a happy girl
#
# COLLABORATION: I did ask a few questions on piazza (and used the API you provided for this lab) but didn't talk to anyone else about it (other that showing my un-web-programming-experienced friend the cool thingy I did)
#
# TIME: Probably about 1.5 hours in total

# PART II:

# WORKING PARTS: I dunno yet :)

# TIME: Weird so i dunno... probably like 2 hours

# COLLABORATION: None with other humans, but I did use a few websites, credited below:
    - For help with Polyline: https://www.sitepoint.com/create-a-polyline-using-the-geolocation-and-the-google-maps-api/ 
    - Course's Piazza (It was helpful - since I'm a bit late to the party, everyone asked all the questions I needed to ask!)
