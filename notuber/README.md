#
# WORKING PARTS: 
	- I think it all works so that makes me a happy girl
# COLLABORATION: 
	-I did ask a few questions on piazza (and used the API you provided for this lab) but didn't talk to anyone else about it (other that showing my un-web-programming-experienced friend the cool thingy I did)
# TIME: 
	- Probably about 1.5 hours in total
# ------PART II------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
#
# WORKING PARTS: 
	- It all works! The polyline and vehicle distance is found, and I even added the pop-up
# TIME: 
	- Probably like 3 hours I think. Working on it has been awkwardly on/off so I don't have a really good estimate
# COLLABORATION: None with other humans, but I did use a few websites, credited below:
    - For help with Polyline: https://www.sitepoint.com/create-a-polyline-using-the-geolocation-and-the-google-maps-api/ 
    - More polyline stuff: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/polyline-simple
    - Course's Piazza (It was helpful - since I'm a bit late to the party, everyone asked all the questions I needed to ask!)
    - Also, used google's maps API and reference for it (duh)
